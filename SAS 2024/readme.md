# The Mutant and Monitor in Space: Automated Discovery of Windows RPC/COM Vulnerabilities - Security Analyst Summit(SAS) 2024

In-depth exploration of Microsoft Remote Procedure Call (RPC) and Component Object Model (COM) has revealed a vast attack surface for those seeking to uncover Local Privilege Escalation (LPE) and Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerabilities. Historically, this research has focused on existing vulnerability patterns, requiring significant time and effort investment. Researchers often find themselves creating custom corpus and fuzzers for each interface definition, while the reverse engineering process proves inefficient and cumbersome.

In this presentation, we introduce XALPC, a cutting-edge RPC/COM fuzzing and monitoring tool designed to streamline the testing and monitoring of system-wide RPC/COM requests. Unlike existing tools, XALPC offers a more efficient approach, leveraging a hook-based framework to fuzz Windows RPC/COM messages at the ALPC level. Additionally, it is equipped to monitor and identify leaked memory information in RPC/COM messages transmitted via ALPC and TCP/IP. Through the utilization of XALPC, we have identified over 10 vulnerabilities, including instances of RCE, LPE, and Sandbox Escape within Windows RPC/COM services. During our presentation, we will provide insight into the operational mechanisms of XALPC and demonstrate its automated vulnerability detection capabilities

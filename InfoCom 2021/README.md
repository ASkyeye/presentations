# Code is the (F)Law Demystifying and Mitigating Blockchain Inconsistency Attacks Caused by Software Bugs -- InfoCom 2021



This is my paper for InfoCom 2021.  The original idea and manuscript of this paper is from my research in 

[All roads lead to Rome: Many ways to double spend your cryptocurrency]: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/329032504_All_roads_lead_to_Rome_Many_ways_to_double_spend_your_cryptocurrency

I ask a friend to rewrite it into an academic paper (he is the first author and I am the corresponding author). Before submitting to INFOCOM 2021, Prof. Chao Zhang  and I were the corresponding authors of this paper. However, when submitting to INFOCOM 2021, **My friend's mentor (Xinhui Han of  Peking University) replaced the corresponding author of the article with his name without even telling me. I think this violates academic ethics**.   It takes a lot of energy to complete an academic paper, so I did not interfere with the publication of the paper in INFOCOM.  But I am very angry about this, so I must publicly point it out here.

我委托一个朋友帮忙把研究的文章改成学术论文（他作为第一作者，我作为通讯作者）。在投稿给InfoCom2021 之前，这篇文章的作者是张超教授和我。但是在投稿给INFOCOM 2021的时候，**我朋友的导师（北京大学的 韩心慧老师）居然把通讯作者换成了他自己，而且这一切并没有通知我。我认为这违反了学术道德** . 写一篇学术论文需要花费很多精力，所以我并没有干涉文章的发表。但是我对这件事情感到非常生气，我必须在这里公开指出来。

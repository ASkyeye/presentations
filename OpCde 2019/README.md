# Danger of Using Fully Homomorphic Encryption，a Look at Microsoft SEAL - Opcde 2019



This is my slides for Opcde 2019

Recently, Microsoft open source the Microsoft Simple Encryption Math Library version 3.1 (Microsoft SEAL). SEAL aims to provide a library of high performance, easy to use homomorphic encryption library. It has been used in several projects including the Intel Neural Network Compiler nGraph. Many companies are currently using SEAL to construct data security applications based on fully homomorphic encryption. It seems that the full homomorphic encryption is very close to practical. In this presentation, we will analyze the security risks of using SEAL and present several practical attacks on applications based on SEAL, we will also present countermeasures for those problems. Our research shows that fully homomorphic encryption still takes a while to be widely used and it’s extremely dangerous to use it without a crypto expert.
